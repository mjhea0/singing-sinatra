Hi! I love Sinatra. I also love clear, concise, readable, testable code, as well as rapid development. So I put together this boilerplate for Sinatra, packed with all my favorite goodies - and it's still much, much lighter than Rails. Plus - It's designed in MVC fashion and ready to deploy on Heroku. Smoke on that.</h4>

### goodie bag:

| goods             | what's it for |
| ----------------- |---------------|
| sinatra           | the framework |
| bootstrap         | the front-end framework     |
| font awesome      | fun icons      |
| postgresql        | production database engine |
| sqlite3           | development/testing database engine
| activerecord      | the ORM |
| sinatra-activerecord | ports activerecord for sinatra |
| tux               | provides a Shell for interaction with the app | 
| rerun             | auto-reloads sinatra after each change |
| haml              | lightweight markup language |
| rspec             | unit testing | 
| sinatra-flash     | 'flash' messages |


rerun ruby app.rb
